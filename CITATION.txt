If you use disloPy in a scientific publication, please consider adding the 
following line in the body of the text somewhere:

    Dislocation calculations were performed using disloPy, a free and open-source
    dislocation simulation package written in Python (Skelton and Walker, 2017).
    
A paper describing the software is in preparation, until this is available please cite:

    Skelton R; Walker AM (2017) Peierls-Nabarro modeling of dislocations in UO2, Journal
    of Nuclear Materials, 495, pp.202-210. doi: 10.1016/j.jnucmat.2017.08.024

which is the first published work making use of disloPy. This file will be updated
as further publications making use of disloPy emerge.
